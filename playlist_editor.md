# Playlist Editor Implementation Plan

## Overview
The PlaylistEditor component is a sophisticated media playlist management interface for the digital signage platform. It provides drag-and-drop functionality, real-time preview, timeline visualization, and screen assignment capabilities.

## Current Status Analysis
The PlaylistEditor.tsx file contains a basic implementation with mock data and UI structure. It needs to be connected to the backend, integrated with the media store, and several dependent components need to be implemented.
